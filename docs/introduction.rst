============

pysatMissionPlanning allows users to run build simulated satellites for TLE info and add empirical data. It includes the pysat_sgp4 and pysat_ephem instrument modules which can be imported into pysat.

Main Features
-------------
- Simulate satellite orbits from TLEs and add data from empirical models
- Import ionosphere and thermosphere values through pyglow
- Import coordinates through apexpy
- Import magnetic coordinates through aacgmv2
- Import geomagnetic basis vectors through pysatMagVect

This document covers installation, a tutorial on pysatMissionPlanning including demonstration code, and an API reference.
